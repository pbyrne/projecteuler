Go Solutions for Project Euler Problems
=======================================

I've been dabbling in [Go][golang] for a while now, but the kinds of problems I solve day-to-day are typically solved well with Bash and Ruby.
This means I don't get a lot of opportunity to try to solve problems with Go.
[Project Euler][pe] gives me an excellent opportunity to do just that.
The plan is to have multiple solutions to many of the problems, as I explore The Go Way, experimenting with channels other tools I've not got much experience with.

You should be able to run any of these in the browser through the [Go Playground][playground].
